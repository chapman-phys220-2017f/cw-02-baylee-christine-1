# Instructor comments

Generally good. Brush up on how to use docstrings vs. comment blocks. 

For your notebook, no need to copy-paste huge blocks of code into the notebook. You should be using the `import` command to load your module code into the notebook, so that you can run it directly. You should never need to use the `input()` function to get input from the user - just call the functions with the proper inputs within the notebook. This also allows you to skip writing a main block in your code, though you can certainly keep one for testing the code from the command-line if desired.
